    question: "What's the difference between a job matching platform and a jobs board?",
    answer: "RemoteReq is a job matching platform, not a jobs board. Here's why - \n\n There are plenty of traditional jobs boards out there. Even a few for remote roles, or part-time and freelance roles. These sites offer pages upon pages (and hours upon hours) of searching, applying, and waiting for responses for employers. Responses that come rarely, if ever. \n\n That's why RemoteReq is a job matching platform. It takes 8-minutes on average to complete a candidate profile and job seeking questionnaire on our platform. From there, we do the searching for you. Our recruiting algorithm identifies 'best fit' job opportunities based upon your preferences and connects you to potential openings on our platform. We get back in touch with you when the right opportunity comes available, and connect you directly to the hiring manager to get moving on next steps. ",
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost to make an employer profile on RemoteReq.com?',
    answer: 'Nothing. Employer profiles are free to create and post remote jobs. Only pay $100 to view your candidate matches for each of your remote roles. Then, if you hire a candidate we connect you to, pay a $900 placement fee for part-time roles or $2,400 for full-time roles.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost to post a job on RemoteReq.com?',
    answer: "Nothing. Employer profiles are free to create, and posting remote jobs is also free. \n\n Our recruiting algorithm will immediately return your 'best fit' candidate matches (up to 5 candidates). Next, pay only $100 for detailed access to your 'best fit' candidate matches, and start interviewing immediately",
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are their two steps to the checkout process for employers?',
    answer: " We want your dollars focused on your mission. Our cost-saving, two-step checkout process ensures that employers only pay for who they hire. After we find your best fit 'candidate matches,' here's what to expect - \n\n Step One: Pay $100 for instant access to detailed profiles for your candidate matches \n\n Step Two:  When you hire one of your candidate matches, pay $900 per part-time hire and $2400 per full-time hire \n\n Other job search platforms and jobs boards charge exorbitant upfront costs with no guarantee of hire. That works for big corporations with deep pockets, but not the little guys. Return on investment is mission-critical.",

  },
  {
    question: 'Why RemoteReq versus some other jobs posting site?',
    answer: 'Glad you asked.

Our cost-saving, two-step checkout process ensures that you pay for only who you hire.)',

    question: 'How long will it take for me to be matched to my "best fit" candidates?',
    answer: 'Usually, it is instant. Occasionally, it will take us a bit longer. A few days, no more than a week. New job seeker profiles are being added daily, so our network is constantly growing with skilled job seekers looking to make a remote impact.',

    answer: 'Yes, keep your search alive. We\'re aggressively pursuing employers to add more jobs added to the platform, and each week, weâ€™re seeing new jobs added. As soon as you have been matched to one of our jobs we will be in touch to  connect you with the hiring manager.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I actually fill out these short-answer questions?',
    answer: 'Yes! The more employers know about you, the more they have to work with. So, go the extra mile. Post thoughtful responses and upload an updated resume. It could be the difference between a call-back, or not.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How will I be notified of a potential match?',
    answer: 'We will email you. Also, your matches will appear in your dashboard. Again, keep your job search alive, see us your personal search partner, and keep your head up. Job searching can be a difficult and frustrating process, at times. Together, we will get there.',

    question: 'How can I help mission-focused organizations in my community?',
    answer: 'Encourage them to visit RemoteReq.com, to create a free, employer account and to post a remote job their hiring for. (The registration process is easier than setting up a Facebook profile.) After seeing how quickly their matched to great candidates, and how affordable our rates are, they will see in what we have to offer.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why mission-focused remote jobs? Why not just remote jobs?',
    answer: "We (not-so) secretly want to make a big impact. RemoteReq allows us to build a bench of highly-qualified remote professionals who are passionate about making their community, country, or world a better place. That is something we can get behind. Our team is a bunch of digital-nomads, and passionate change-agents. We value flexibility in our work, but we also value purpose. \n\n Finally, there are plenty of options for the 'big guys' to find the talent they need to drive huge profits. Nothing wrong with that. We just want to focus our efforts and network on helping the 'good guys' to make a great impact. From anywhere.",
