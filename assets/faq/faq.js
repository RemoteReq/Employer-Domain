    question: "What's the difference between a job matching platform and a jobs board?",
    answer: "RemoteReq is a job matching platform, not a jobs board. Here's why - \n\n There are plenty of traditional jobs boards out there. Even a few for remote roles, or part-time and freelance roles. These sites offer pages upon pages (and hours upon hours) of searching, applying, and waiting for responses for employers. Responses that come rarely, if ever. \n\n That's why RemoteReq is a job matching platform. It takes 8-minutes on average to complete a candidate profile and job seeking questionnaire on our platform. From there, we do the searching for you. Our recruiting algorithm identifies 'best fit' job opportunities based upon your preferences and connects you to potential openings on our platform. We get back in touch with you when the right opportunity comes available, and connect you directly to the hiring manager to get moving on next steps. ",
