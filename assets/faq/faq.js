    question: 'Who can post on RemoteReq?',
    answer: 'Nonprofit organizations or mission-focused, for-profit organizations of all sizes. Is the primary focus of your business to address an issue facing your community, country, or world? If so, then RemoteReq would love to help you find the talent you need to further your cause.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are their two steps to the checkout process for employers?',
    answer: 'We are saving you money. On other platforms, the cost to post (usually a few thousand dollars) is paid all upfront, regardless of output. For cost-sensitive, nonprofits and small businesses, even a few hundred bucks can make a big difference. It can be the difference between posting to a platform and reaching a potential pool of candidates or not.',
