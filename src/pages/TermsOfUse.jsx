        </p>

        <br/>

        <h4>Service Only Provides a Venue</h4>

        <p>
          The Service is a platform for enabling connections between Users for the fulfillment of Assignments,
          but Company is not responsible for the performance of Users, nor does it have control over the quality,
          timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Assignments, nor of the integrity,
          responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company does not have control
          over the quality, timing or legality of Assignments delivered by Providers.
          Company makes no representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the
          Assignments requested and provided by Users identified through the Service whether in public, private,
          or offline interactions.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h4>User Vetting</h4>

        <p>
          Clients and Providers may be subject to an extensive vetting process before they can register and
          during their use of the Service, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a
          comprehensive criminal background check, at the Country, State and local level, using third party
          services as appropriate. Users hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as
          required in compliance with federal and state laws and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>
          Although Company may perform background checks of Users, as outlined above,
          Company cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be and therefore,
          Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or
          reliability identity or background check information or any information provided through the Service.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>
          When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect
          your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom

        <h4>Billing and Payment</h4>

          Users of the Service will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Company and the Payment Service Provider retained by Company (the “PSP”).
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>
          Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Assignment (the “Invoice”), which will include the pricing terms of the Assignment agreed with and provided by a Provider (“Assignment Payment”), any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by a Provider in connection with the Assignment, any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and the fee the Company assesses for the Service, based on the Assignment Payment amount.  Client agrees to pay all Invoices by the date and according to the terms set forth therein.  Any late payment may be automatically charged to the Client’s account and shall bear interest at a rate of 1.5% per month.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>
        Providers may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Terms of Service between Providers and the PSP retained by Company are available here (the “PSP Agreement”). By accepting these Terms of Use, each Provider agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement. Please note that the Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement (currently, Stripe) are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that the Company has no obligations or liability to any Provider under the PSP Agreement.  Provider agrees that Company is not responsible for payment, and that all payments are based on hours reported by the Client.  Company will not be responsible for any disputes or discrepancies.  Client agrees that Company shall have no obligation to process any refund or reimbursement after a payment has been made to a Provider and that Company shall not be responsible for adjustments to payments or hours worked for which Client fails to provide timely written notice to Company.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>
          Within 24 hours after Client receives confirmation through the Service or via email that an Assignment has been completed, Client authorizes Company to provide Client’s payment details to the PSP for processing of Assignment Payment, out of pocket expenses owed to Provider, any tip or gratuity, if applicable, and any fees owed to Company for the use of the Service. You may be charged a cancellation fee of half of the cost of the assignment through the PSP if you book an Assignment, but cancel with less than 24 hours notice or substantially modify it before it is completed, as set forth in the Assignment pricing terms.
          Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (i) place on hold any Assignment Payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.
        </p>

        </p>

        <br/>

        <h4>Release</h4>

        <p>
          The Service is only a venue for connecting Users.

User shall and hereby does waive California Civil Code Section 1542, or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
          Company expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Users of the Service.

        <br/>

        <p>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION. Arbitration will take place in Austin, Texas. You and Company agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the Texas state and Federal courts located in Austin, Texas have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
